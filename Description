Library Mangement
It is a project using python and mysql.
Python is used to program the software and mysql is used to store data.
In this Library management ,  I have connected my local database named Library and different tables related to each other with foreign keys.
The tables are: 
book table for storing the data of book like bookID, bookName, authorName, price, copies and remaining copies.
member table for storing the data of memberID, memberName,memberAddress and phone
issue table for storing data of issueId, issueDate, memberID as foreign key, bookid as foreign key, copies.
returns table for storing data of returnID, returnDate, memberID, bookID,copies
In python, i have different functions for creation, read, update and deletion CRUD operations.
